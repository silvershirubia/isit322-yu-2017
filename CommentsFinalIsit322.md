# Comments Final

Comments on Final for Sylvia.

- Understanding: Good.
- Discipline, enthusiasm, attitude: Good.

You earned an A for the quarter.

You had a great quarter. Your final was very nice. That was what did it for you. You turned in a great final, showing that you had learned a great deal. You should be proud.

## GitExplorer

- Compiles and runs with concurrency from GitExplorer/server directory
- Runs with cleanly except for error on delete. The delete works, but I don't think it refreshes properly. Same on Heroku.
  - No warnings at start up.
- Does load from MongoDB

## Features

- Get User info does load properly.  
- Create Gist does load properly.
- List Gists does load properly.
  - Delete Gist works, and does refresh properly
- You do not use another feature of the Git API
- Redux
  - I don't see lots of Redux but it is there GetFoo, GetMicro and SmallNumbers.

## Micro Services

You:

- Started at least two micro services with concurrently
- Use the database from a micro service. I think.

## Heroku

Heroku runs beautifully. Exceptionally nice. Good work.

## Native

It compiles and loads, but then errors out. You have p and button tags. You need to switch to the native react components with names like **Text** and **Button**. But at least you give me something I can look at.

## Tests

Basic stats reported after run all:

```
Test Suites: 2 failed, 3 passed, 5 total
Tests:       11 failed, 18 passed, 29 total
```

Its okay. I know you did better in earlier commits.
